			+"<div id='h3-body-plain'>"
			+"<p>Founded:   1900</p>"
			+"<p>History: After their arrival in India the first missionaries of this group, <a href='http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/ressler_jacob_andrews_1867_1936'>Bishop Jacob A. Ressler</a> and <a href='http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/contents/P348.html'>Dr. and Mrs. Page</a>, chose Sundarganj, at the edge of Dhamtari, as the site for their work, and in the autumn of 1899 they struck their tents under mango trees in a lovely grove. Soon the famine of 1899-1900 was upon them. Famine subjects began to pour into Dhamtari and surrounding villages and the missionaries were requested to open a famine relief center. The government officials arranged with the missionaries to give people work on the mission premises where the construction of buildings had been started, the government furnishing the funds and the mission furnishing the material. Thus the first evangelistic opportunity was with the thousands of famine sufferers among whom were nearly a thousand orphans. During 1901-1902 Jacob and Mrs. Burkhard and Mahlon C. and Mrs. Lapp arrived, and the work could be organized into orphanage work, medical work, industrial and rehabilitation work, and evangelism through education and special Bible teaching. A number of families who remained in or near Dhamtari after the famine relief became Christian converts and were baptized and received into church fellowship, and many orphans were under special instruction for baptism. This resulted in a very rapid growth of the Christian membership.</p>"
			+"<p>Sundarganj became the headquarters of the American Mennonite (MC) Mission. At this station were located the treasurer, the Christian Academy, a large staff of missionaries and Christian teachers, and evangelistic workers.</p>"
			+"<p>Shantipur Leper Homes, Rudri, and Balodgahan stations were the natural outgrowth of the work established at Sundarganj. From the lepers fed in separate kitchens near Sundarganj a leper asylum was established near Dhamtari which afterward developed into the Shantipur Leper Homes. The shifting of the orphan girls to a home separate from the boys gave rise to the mission station of Rudri. To meet the need for Christian community expansion, especially on the land, the village of Balodgahan was bought in 1906. In 1957 the membership was 589, with D. A. Sonwani and J. H. Flisher serving as ministers in charge.</p>"

			+"<h3>About Dhamtari</h3>"
			+"<div id='h3-body-plain'>"
			+"<p>Dhamtari, with a population of 17,278 in 1955, was an important town in the Raipur District, Madhya Pradesh, India. [It became part of the new Chhattisgarh state in 2000.] It was headquarters for the Dhamtari Tahsil, a political division comparing approximately to a county in the United States. Its importance lay also in the fact that it was the terminus of a narrow-gauge railway line from Raipur, 80 km (50 miles) to the north on the main Bombay-Calcutta line of the Bengal Nagpur railway. From here roads radiated to the south, east, and west, so that Dhamtari became the trading and shipping center for points 150 and more km distant. Among the goods shipped from Dhamtari were forest products such as timber, shellac, morabulum nuts and biri (cigarette) leaves, along with rice, hides, and other farm produce.</p>"
			+"<p>Dhamtari was the headquarters of the Mennonite Church (MC) in India (successor to the American Mennonite Mission), established in 1899 and merged with the church organization in 1952. There was in 1955 a congregation of 558 members, worshiping in a large brick church. The Dhamtari Christian Academy, Dhamtari Christian Hospital, Samuel Burkhard Memorial Boys' Orphanage, and a nursing school were church-mission institutions located here. JDG</p>"
			+"<hr/>"
			+"<p>Dhamtari, India is situated 75 km (48 miles) south of the district headquarters of the city of Raipur on the national highway No. 43 (which runs from Delhi to Madras) dividing the city into the eastern larger and older part with shopping center and the western newer section. In 1986 Dhamtari had a population of 60,000, reflecting considerable growth from the municipality (9,151 population in 1881) that existed when the Mennonite missionaries first arrived in 1899. Dhamtari has been a political nerve center since the days of the struggle for India's independence and Mahatma Gandhi visited the town twice (20 December 1920 and 24 November 1933).</p>"
			+"<p>The American Mennonite mission was a pioneer in education, medical, and vocational training institutions. In 1987 there were seven high schools, 25 primary schools, and one polytechnic institution, a government college of arts, commerce, and science. The religious affiliation of the population was: Hindu (76 percent); Muslim (12 percent); Sindhi (2 percent); Punjabi (1 percent); Christian (1.5 percent) and others (7.5 percent).</p>"
			+"<p>Dhamtari is the headquarters of the Mennonite Church in India, the location of its annual conference, and the site of such Christian institutions as the Dhamtari Christian Hospital, the Mennonite Higher Secondary (Hindi) School and the Mennonite English Medium Higher Secondary School.
