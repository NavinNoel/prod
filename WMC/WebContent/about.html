				+"<p>Greetings and Welcome!</p>"
				+"<p>I am excited to serve as the pastor at Whitehall Mennonite Church. Originally from Iowa, I have spent the last 20 years living on the East Coast (but am still a mid-westerner at heart).  I graduated from Messiah College in 1991, and began a career in teaching high school history and the social sciences, first in Delaware and then in Trenton, NJ.  I loved working with young people-teaching, coaching, and mentoring-but I grew weary of the grading!  Eventually, the Lord led me to me to seminary and in 2005, I earned my M.Div. from Bethel Seminary of the East.  In 2006, I began a two-year volunteer program through Mennonite Mission Network as a Unit Director of the Service Adventure Program in Johnstown, PA.  Here I was able to mentor and disciple young people with whom I lived in community-as well as test out my pastoral calling by preaching and serving at First Mennonite Church of Johnstown.  In August 2008, the Lord called me to serve as interim pastor at Stahl Mennonite Church, in Johnstown, and on February 7, 2010, I was installed at Whitehall.</p>"
				+"<p>I am the youngest of six children and maintain close relationships with my siblings, nieces and nephews, and their children.  I have many interests, including sports, writing, reading, quilting, and hiking!   Though it's been cold and snowy since I arrived, I am enjoying the beauty of the Lehigh Valley-and can't wait to explore the region this spring!   God has blessed me richly with wonderful friends and family and I look forward to developing even more friendships here.</p>"
				+"<p>Whitehall is composed of a diverse group of people a church who have made a choice to commit themselves to God and one another.  I have been impressed and challenged by the practicality of their faith.  I am passionate about helping them continue to grow and stretch in their faith and believe God will do a great work here in the coming years.</p>"
				+"<p>Grace and Peace,</p>"
